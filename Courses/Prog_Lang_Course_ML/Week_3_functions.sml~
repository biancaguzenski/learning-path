(* First-class functions: functions can be passed as arguments of other functions, can be values of variables, can be part of tuples, can be anything - functions are values, so they can be used wherever you can put some value
In funtional programming this is a key concept - as well as avoid mutation, encourage recursion, style closer to mathematical definitions, etc *)

fun double x = x * 2
fun increment x = x + 1
val a_tuple = (double, increment, double(increment 7))
val ans = (#1 a_tuple) 9
