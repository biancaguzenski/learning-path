## Programming Languages, part B - University of Washington

**This repo contain my solutions for the assignments and projects of this course.**

ABOUT/SOBRE

* This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis in functional programming. The course uses the language Racket but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to turn you into a more effective programmer. This course will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs.
* Esse curso é uma introdução as linguagens de programação. O primeiro módulo foca na linguagem Racket, uma linguagem funcional.
