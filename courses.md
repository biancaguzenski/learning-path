  | [Programming Languages, Part A - ML language](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)	| This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones. This course will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. | Finished | [Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/tree/master/Courses/Prog_Lang_Course_ML) | [Ref](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/blob/master/ref.md) | * |
