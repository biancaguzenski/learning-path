  | University of Washington -[Programming Languages, Part A - ML language](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)	| This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis in functional programming. The course uses the language SML but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to turn you into a more effective programmer. This course will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. | Finished | [Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/tree/master/Courses/Prog_Lang_Course_ML) | [Ref](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/blob/master/ref.md) | [Link](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/QUXSFP4WUWGS) |
