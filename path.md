Although you can use any language to learn programming, C is a important tool for you to understand how things really happen under the hood (like memory allocation).

### Core programming
##### Topics covered: functional programming, design for testing, program requirements, common design patterns, unit testing, object-oriented design, Lisp-family languages, Ruby and more

| [How to Code - Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data) | (Very basic stuff, if you programmed before it might be a little slow) - This programming course takes a unique approach, as it focuses on learning a systematic programming method rather than a programming language. This practical approach will help you channel your creativity so that you can program well in any language. |	50h | Finished | |
| [How to Code - Complex Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-complex-data) | As your program requirements get more complex, you will find that simple additions to the design method make it easy to write well-structured and well-tested code that is easy to maintain. |	40h	| Finished | |
| [Programming Languages, Part A - ML language](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)	| This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones. This course will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. | 40h | Finished | [Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/blob/master/courses.md) |

|[Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) | In this project-centered course you will build a modern computer system, from the ground up. Course is divided into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed. | 65h | Finished | [Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/Nand2Tetris)
|[Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)| In this project-centered course you will build a modern software hierarchy, designed to enable the translation and execution of object-based, high-level languages on a bare-bone computer hardware platform. In particular, you will implement a virtual machine and a compiler for a simple, Java-like programming language, and you will develop a basic operating system that closes gaps between the high-level language and the underlying hardware platform | 90h | Finished |[Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/Nand2Tetris) |
|[Introduction to Computer Networking](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAYkSg4uSQ2dr0XO_Nwa5OcdEcaaELSG)| This is an introductory course on computer networking, specifically the Internet. It focuses on explaining how the Internet works, ranging from how bits are modulated on wires and in wireless to application-level protocols like BitTorrent and HTTP. It also explains the principles of how to design networks and network protocols. Students gain experience reading and understanding RFCs (Internet protocol specifications) as statements of what a system should do. The course grounds many of the concepts in current practice and recent developments, such as net neutrality and DNS security.| 70h - Assignments: [Ass 1](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/COS461-Public/tree/master/assignments/assignment1) [Ass2](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/10au-cs144/lab/reliable/reliable.html) [Ass3](https://nptel.ac.in/content/storage2/courses/106105080/pdf/M2L7.pdf) [Ass4](http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/Wireshark_TCP_v7.0.pdf) | In progress | [Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/tree/master/Projects/Networks_Stanford_Course)

This course teaches the basic operating system abstractions, mechanisms, and their implementations. The core of the course contains concurrent programming (threads and synchronization), inter process communication, and an introduction to distributed operating systems. | 50h | - | [Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/tree/master/Courses/Operat_Systems_Courses) |

ps.: acctualy i did the core theory module before core system. Here i prefered to put after because most of my references did the same.
