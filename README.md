# This repo is a diary-review-to-do-list-done-list of my learning path.

As i decided to learn by myself (although you are never by yourself, you need help from several talented minds that cross your path), i've choosen to follow curricular standards of a degree program in computer science and mix with things i would like to learn. Find resources [here](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).
