# This repo is a diary/to do list of my learning path.

As i decided to learn by myself (although you are never by yourself, you need help from several talented minds that cross your path), i've choosen to follow curricular standards of a degree program in computer science and mix with things i would like to learn. In this [link](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) you find some resources i used to build this learning path.

### My stuff

1. [My projects](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/blob/master/projects.md)
2. [List - Finished courses](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/blob/master/courses.md)

| [Programming Languages, Part A - ML language](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)	| This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones. This course will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. | 40h | In progress | [Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/tree/master/Projects/ML) |
