## This repo is a diary/to do list of my learning path.

As i decided to learn by myself (although you are never by yourself, you need help from several talented minds that cross your path), i've choosen to follow curricular standards of a degree program (UFRGS - Brasil) in computer science and mix with specific topics i would like to learn. Feel free to use this content to build your own learning path.
In this [link](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) you find some resources i used to build this learning path. (other resources: [every programmer should know](https://github.com/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know), [teach yourself computer science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), [open source cs](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs))

### Introduction to Computer Science
##### Topics covered: C, computation, imperative programming, basic data structures

| Course | Info | Duration/Effort | Status | Repo |
|--|--|--|--|--| 
| [Intro to computer science using C](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/blob/master/courses.md) | Programming and C language | 36h | Finished | [Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/blob/master/courses.md) |

Although you can use any language to learn programming, C is a important tool for you to understand how things really happen under the hood (like memory allocation).

### Core programming
##### Topics covered: functional programming, design for testing, program requirements, common design patterns, unit testing, object-oriented design, Lisp-family languages, Ruby and more

| Course | Info | Duration/Effort | Status | Repo |
|--|--|--|--|--| 
| [How to Code - Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data) | (Very basic stuff, if you programmed before it might be a little slow) - This programming course takes a unique approach, as it focuses on learning a systematic programming method rather than a programming language. This practical approach will help you channel your creativity so that you can program well in any language. |	70h | Finished | |
| [How to Code - Complex Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-complex-data) | As your program requirements get more complex, you will find that simple additions to the design method make it easy to write well-structured and well-tested code that is easy to maintain. |	60h	| Finished | |
| [Programming Languages, Part A - ML language](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)	| This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones. This course will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. | 40h | Finished | [Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/tree/master/Projects/ML) |
| [Programming Languages, Part B - Racket language](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b)	| Concepts of programming languages, now using racket | 24h | Finished | [Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/tree/master/Projects/Prog_Lang_Course_Racket) |
| [Programming Languages, Part C - Ruby language](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c)	| Concepts of programming languages, now using ruby | 24h | Finished | [Repo](https://github.com/biancaguzenski/learning-path/tree/master/Projects/Prog_Lang_Course_Ruby) |

ps.: acctualy i did the core theory module before core system. Here i prefered to put after because most of my references did the same.
