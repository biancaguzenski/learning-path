## This repo is a diary/to do list of my learning path.

As I decided to learn by myself (although you are never by yourself, you need help from several talented minds that cross your path), I've choosen to follow curricular standards of a degree program (UFRGS - Brasil) in computer science and mix with specific topics I would like to learn. Feel free to use this content if you like.
In this [link](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) you find some resources I used to build this learning path. (other resources: [every programmer should know](https://github.com/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know), [teach yourself computer science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), [open source cs](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs))
